NOTE: this tutorial worked on Linux-Ubuntu 20.04. I installed in in february 2024 (if you want to check the versions for the programs).
I do not guarantee this will work for you, or for another OS.
Furthermore, sometimes, this is just me talking to myself an noting the errors I got, how to solve them, etc. Some things lead to dead-ends: I leave them here just for the sake of completeness, and just in case you thought about it and tried it and don't find any info anywhere.

Using this tutorial: https://github.com/lunelis/sensor_fusion (from TFE of 2022, Lucas Nélis, go in the README).

For kerl: 
First things first : do the commands from the tutorial (https://github.com/grisp/grisp/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Development-Environment), GRiSP tutorial, how to set up an environment.
Then ADD IT TO YOUR PATH, see : (https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/) (beware if you modify directly bashrc, different commands than in shell)
Install Erlang. If any package is missing, install it (gcc, + many others, see this link: (https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang/pull/10/files) this is for asdf, but the same goes for kerl. wxWidget didn't work for me.

Upon using : kerl install 25.3 /usr/local/lib/erlang/25.3, I had MANY problems (Access denied).
The user with which I install Erlang did not have the rights on the directory. So, to solve this issue, go to said directory and type: sudo chmod 777 directoryName.
This will allow to read, write and execute for anybody on the computer on the directory. If the error message happens on a subdirectory, do the same on it.
BUT BEWARE, it is ugly and can be dangerous: anyone on your computer can now modify your Erlang installation... But who would?
The rest should go fine. You now have Erlang (in my case, 25.3) installed on your computer!

Rebar3: go to: https://github.com/erlang/rebar3 follow tutorial in getting started. 
Once in cd rebar3 and ./bootstrap, I got the error message: "OTP Application crypto not available. Please fix your Erlang install to support it and try again."
This is probably because I install ssl (ssh command in link earlier) AFTER installing Erlang. I hope you didn't do the same mistake.
If you did, delete the installation then the build and redo with ALL packages installed.
Once you did all this, ./bootstrap should work better (green lines with ===> at the start).
Then ./rebar3 local install.

GRiSP rebar3 plugin: the tutorial says to add the plugin for GRiSP in the /.config/rebar3/rebar.config file... Which did not exist for me.
I created the directory and rebar.config and added the plugin configuration.
Upon doing the update, the window said "no escript". Be sure to have an active Erlang/OTP on in your window when you do the commands.
Now, you maybe have errors loading the plugin. This is getting tricky.
The way to solve it is to force the place where the files are. You should replace the given code by this:

{plugins, [
{rebar3_hex, {git, "https://github.com/erlef/rebar3_hex.git", {branch, "main"}}},
{rebar3_grisp, {git, "https://github.com/grisp/rebar3_grisp.git", {branch, "master"}}}
]}.

TO GO FASTER: crtl+r and type start of command.
DO NOT FORGET: to have rebar3, etc. running, you need a valid Erlang session: 
	. /usr/local/lib/erlang/25.3/activate 
(Depending on your version, put the right one).
By the way, do not forget to also add rebar3 to your PATH: 
	export PATH=$PATH:~/.cache/rebar3/bin

Once everything is setup, you can try the example given by the GRiSP team (LED)! To run the program, do the tutorial, load on the SD card as explained and insert it into the GRiSP.
Create a new app: be in the rebar3 folder, type: rebar3 new grispapp name=Name dest=/whereisyourSDcard
Me: rebar3 new grisapp name=Name dest=/media/nicolas/GRISP
This creates a folder in rebar3. You can take this folder wherever you want, the commands for rebar3 will work if you added it to your path. 

CONNECTION OVER SERIAL:
To connect over Serial (USB) and open a GRiSP terminal: 
	sudo picocom /dev/ttyUSB1 --baud 115200 --echo 
(in the app folder).
To leave picocom without cancelling the program (q().), use crtl+a then ctrl+q. This works apparently only for tty, not for the connection over Wi-fi, for which you type q(). in the Erlang shell first before doing the classical ctrl+c.


WIFI: 
I recommand, if you want to understand what is happening, to do it on a "random project", like the example project mentioned earlier. This will allow you to 
train yourself with the commands and maybe better understand what is happening. I followed the tutorial from the GRiSP page (https://github.com/grisp/grisp/wiki/Connecting-over-WiFI-and-Ethernet). 
Follow the guide up until "Finding out the IP address of the GRiSP board when using DHCP", at which point you will have a problem, because the GRiSP (maybe) never connected to Wifi before.
To do so, follow the guide at GRiSP INI, then Configuring Wi-fi. Next, deploy the app as per usual (a priori, make deploy-nav_1). Put it into the GRiSP board and restart the board.
You should now see messages in the shell about wlan0 mentioning errors (File exists). This should not be a problem.
Now, using 
	inet:getifaddrs().
you should see under wlan0 the address of your GRiSP board.
Follow again the tutorial and add with sudo /etc/hosts the Wifi of your board.
Next, use erl -sname my_remote_shell -remsh my_project@my_grisp_board -setcookie MyCookie
In my case, it was: erl -sname my_remote_shell -remsh robot_HB5@testing_the_wifi -setcookie CookieNicolas in the case of my application.

This whole process can be repeated on the sensor_fusion application. I'm using the makefile to do so, as detailed on the Git repo of Lucas.
For me : 
	make deploy-testing_the_wifi !nav_1 necessary.
The given name in itself should not a problem (IT IS), since it takes the "env.NAME" variable in grisp.ini.mustache! The NAME variable is attributed to whatever commes after the deploy-%.
For the first GRiSP, beware that the MyCookie is set by default and that the project name should be sensor_fusion.
You can indeed see in the makefile under the "remote shell" part that it calls sensor_fusion.

Beware: if you want to connect over wifi, do not q(). the Erlang VM before leaving picocom as I mentioned earlier. Modify that.


********************* Added on 04/03. A lot of it are just notes, maybe not especially important for everybody.

Beware: I tried to be smart and put my computer node twice in the erl_inetrc file, so I did not have to care about whether I was at home or not. Guess it does not like having twice the same name, however. Comment the node which you don't need and rebuild.

Also, make sure the network that the GRiSP is trying to reach (Wi-fi) is not disabled. 

Beware of syntax error in the erl_inetrc file. Instead of separating the numbers by a "," I typed an IP address with "."!

Then, you can open a remote shell with: 
	erl -sname my_remote_shell -remsh sensor_fusion@testing_the_wifi -setcookie MyCookie
This led to a : *** ERROR: Shell process terminated! (^G to start new job) ***
I tried switching to my connection sharing for the computer. It gave me another IP address compared to when I tried earlier. Putting this into erl_inetrc and rebuilding then using the command mentioned above worked. The name is the same you put during "make deploy-name".

Using "make shell" works, but the clean start "make local_release && make run_local" does not, with error: "Could not start kernel pid",application_controller,"invalid config data: application: grisp; duplicate parameter: devices"
In home/nicolas/TFE/sensor_fusion/_build/computer/rel/sensor_fusion/releases/1.0.0/, several files are available. In sys.config, two {devices} variables were set. This comes from the computer.config.src in the config folder. I commented one of the two and rebuild.

Now, it says it doesn't find numerl.so. It points to "sensor_fusion/src/numerl.erl", line 9.
Hold on to me: so, line 9 call erlang:load_nif. load_nif takes as first argument the file path to the shareable object/dynamic library, minus the OS-dependent extension (.so in Linux), here, "numerl". However, numerl.so seems to be moved in the trash, as shown by the command "find /home -name numerl.so". Problem!	
According to this wiki (https://github.com/grisp/grisp/wiki/NIF-Support), there are some special requirements, such as having a main C file named NAMEOFDRIVER_nif.c. and this file must reside in the application top level folder, under the following path: grisp/<platform>/<version>/build/nifs/NAMEOFDRIVER_nif.c
In my case, I did grisp/grisp2/default/build/nifs/numerl_nif.c
Initially, it was located under grisp/grisp2/common/build/nifs/numerl_nif.c
This returned an even weirder error, upon rebuilding it: 

* Patching
    [grisp] 00100-rtems.patch (already applied, skipping)
    [grisp] 00300-drivers-nifs.patch
===> sh(git apply --ignore-whitespace 00300-drivers-nifs.patch) %% Note: this file can be found in _grisp/grisp2/otp/<your_version>/build/
failed with return code 1 and the following output:
error: patch failed: erts/emulator/Makefile.in:938 %% At this line, we find: ASMJIT_PCH_OBJ=$(TTF_DIR)/asmjit/asmjit.hpp.gch
error: erts/emulator/Makefile.in: patch does not apply

So either my tactic is wrong, or there is something I don't understand.
Back to the original version. In the shell, I get this message: 

===> Preparing

    [sensor_fusion] erts/emulator/nifs/common/numerl_nif.c %% SO apparently, it DOES copy it. So the question is: why is it not available to be used in the GRiSP?
    
I decided to try and continue with make shell.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
05/03: I saw in e11.erl that it is asking for hera_data:get(nav3, sensor_fusion@nav_1). So I guess the name WAS important.
Both of which I don't have, I did nav with testing_the_wifi. After rebuild, I deployed it named nav_1. 
It struggled to connect to Wi-fi but eventually did.

When I call sensor_fusion:launch()., it does a "try launch(node_type())". 
node_type() is a function which checks the name of the host (e.g. : nav_1) and takes the prefix as a node. So, it knows it has a nav!
If everything is fine, it launches 
	{ok,_} = hera:start_measure(nav3, Cn), % THIS CALLS FOR THE CALIBRATION VALUES. If everything is ok, it goes on.
    	{ok,_} = hera:start_measure(e11, R0),
If everything is fine, starts hera:start_measure, which calls for a hera_measure_sup:start_child. The module is the name given, so nav3 and e11 and the arguments are the calibration values. This will start supervisors which execute the two modules with the arguments. From there, I suppose it is smart enough to do the measures.

It appears the call to e11 should measure. Upon calling this function, it should do hera_data:get(nav3, sensor_fusion@nav_1) but it seems like it is never launched.
Upon launching launch_all(), it returns badrpc, meaning some node (and I suspect it is my computer) are not well taken care of.

Weird. Calling the single node should launch the measure on that node, but I see no way of doing so in the code.
I tried this : 
	sensor_fusion:launch().
	R0 = ets:lookup_element(args, {e11, node()}, 2).
	{ok, State, Spec} = e11:init(R0). 
	e11:measure(State).  
And this printed the quaternion representation of the PMOD_NAV orientation. SO IT WORKS! But why is nothing being written anywhere when I launch a measure?

Don't forget to do the calibration first: sensor_fusion:set_args(nav3). for this 3D orientation.


07/03: 
The SD card went into read-only mode, because I interrupted the deploy process (or the build? I don't know). To solve the problem, unlock your SD card as shown here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/213889/microsd-card-is-set-to-read-only-state-how-can-i-write-data-on-it
Then type: sudo mount -orw,remount *yourSDcardPATH*

08/03: something I hadn't done, but maybe is important: in the config folder, computer.config.src and sys.config, remember to modify this line to adapt to your computer:

{sync_nodes_optional, [
        sensor_fusion@nicolas-HP-ZBook-Studio-G4,  <--
        sensor_fusion@nav_1
    ]},
BY THE WAY: as you can see in the name, I had "-" in the computer name. This lead to trouble with sys.config during the deployement. To solve this, on Linux:
	- On the top left corner, go to Activities;
	- Search for About;
	- The first thing will be the computer name: you can change it to whatever, without a "-" or arithmetic sign.

If you have the brilliant idea, as I did, to take every repository referred to in the rebar.config to make it your owns so that you can edit them (easier debugging), here is how to do it:
	- Go on your Github account ;
	- Create the repositories: I recommand keeping hera and hera_synchronization as default names for these, but your "main repository", you can call it what you want. It will still be called sensor_fusion on the GRiSP, but who cares ;
	- Locally clone all the repositories, then download the original repositories (download the .zip, easier), put everything inside the CORRECT folder.
	- Then the usual: git add * ; git commit -m "Initial commit for ..." ; git push -u origin main ; 
	- Once the repositories are set up, you can now go and modify all the rebar.config, computer.config.src, etc. to put your names and reference your repositories. You will have to change stuff in the hera repo and in the main repo. Nothing to change in hera_synchronization.
	- Push every changes.
	- Delete _grisp and _build in the main folder.
	- rebar3 grisp build. 
You should have everything working now !


10/03: to make it work (it was not working because log_data was at false, despite hardcoding its value to true), remove rebar.lock (by renaming it or straight up removing it) and in Hera folders, check everywhere for this configuration (NOT ONLY in the main folder, as mentioned in the original tutorial. This only works for when you start the app on your computer. But if you start it on the GRiSP, you need to modify the hera version). Typically: hera/ebin -> hera.app and hera/src -> hera.app.src. Push every changes to your git repositories, make sure no rebar.lock still exists, delete for good measure the _build and _grisp folders everywhere you find one, and all your changes will appear in the newly built version.


11/03: attempting to add an environment variable to get the comments to show on will. 
Had this message again: ===> Skipping hera_synchronization (from {git,"https://github.com/Neackow/hera_synchronization",
                                {ref,"6730a2f56694961cc1c4b75e2d3e8737b469eeb8"}}) as an app of the same name has already been fetched
Should not pose that much of a problem since nothing ever changes on this, so either version works (sebkm or mine). 

Added the variable both to my computer env and the Hera env.

Beware, again: the _build folder (in hera and movement_detection) contains the previous version of the configuration files. Whenever you change something in the config files, remove these folders. SHOULD HAVE BEEN AUTOMATISED.

Note: the _build in hera is due to me compiling it manually to verify if everything is fine. It is not really important. What is important is the version you can find in the _build folder of the movement_detection app.

This however takes MUCH MORE TIME to compile. So, if it is only a question of Erlang code, rebar3 compile is better than a full build. It will be important to explain. But actually, what is important? A full build all the time? Just a compilation? It really is not clear.

About rebar.lock : rebar.lock is where the version of dependencies are locked. This way our builds are reproducible, meaning if no code has been changed in a repository, the build on the repo should always have the same result (https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/issues/2604). So deleting this file (in my case, renaming it as olDrebar.lock) is not really a problem.
This often causes problems to me. It reappears when I build and if I forget to remove it, it will waste 15 minutes of my life, waiting for a build that is not taking the last modifications into account. Do not forget to remove it (or it may have been automatised).


%% NOTE TO SELF %%
If I automatised everything (the build folders and all) during the build, then I should specify in the doc the folder organisation.
%% END OF NOTE %%

About make local_release && make run_local commands: I have a NIF problem: numerl.so is not loading, and apparently, according to Sébastien Kalbusch (Hera developper from 2021), it is normal and if I wanted to have the possibility of running the code directly on my console, the NIF should be discarded on my computer. Which is a problem, since I need it. To have the logs directly appearing on my computer and not having to remove the SD card continuously, I should deal with that.


While looking at which code to modify, I noticed that in sensor_fusion.app.src, modules were present. I do not know if it is done automatically or if I will have to add modules there.
At the end of Lunelis' README, one can see that it is easy to add a sensor_fusion model or a new library. I do believe that the new sensor_fusion model must be added in the .app file to be taken into account, however.


Also today: merging the code for the numerl version (updated math version) and the movement detection thesis. In the version from numerl, many functions were adapted to the mathematically updated version (typically, by checking the differences between e11.erl with and without nurmerl, we see less calls to the "mat" module and more "matrix operations in Erlang" operations). To keep in mind if I find a problem.


Upon launching the sensor_fusion:launch()., if I give him enough time, I will have the following error:

=SUPERVISOR REPORT==== 1-Jan-1988::00:01:20.066604 ===

               {child_type,worker}]
               
While it does not seem to be a problem, since it restarts a hera_measure process right after, why do I have this? Also, I get the same type of error upon launching sensor_fusion:realtime_once().:

sensor_fusion:realtime_once().
Start Realtime with 10 seconds for the gesture
** exception exit: {timeout,
                       {gen_server,call,

     in call from realtime:start/3 (/home/nicolas/TFE/movement_detection/src/realtime.erl, line 10)
     
And I don't really know what to do about it. From (https://learnyousomeerlang.com/clients-and-servers#callback-to-the-future) : The TimeOut variable is meant to be added to the tuple whenever you need a deadline before which you expect the server to receive a message. If no message is received before the deadline, a special one (the atom timeout) is sent to the server, which should be handled with handle_info/2.

We work here with synchronous messages. From this forum (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61618091/why-does-gen-server-get-timeout), maybe I should try and implement a handle_info(), but the fact is that we are calling from the outside world, so I don't know if it is important. This page says that the things timeout because of {noreply,_,_} but here, it is set to {reply,_,_}.
The default timeout is 5 seconds, which is what is observed in practice.

This (https://blog.differentpla.net/blog/2019/09/21/gen_server-timeout/) mentions a coding solution. Maybe too much.

I did some prints in the handle_call function. This lead to the observation that it appears to work up until a certain point, by which I mean it looped several time before reaching a sort of "dead-end" where it was sending the reply and then after 5 seconds it would crash. 

13/03: We added printing the [Res] parameter, to check what it is.
A frequent warning I get is: *WARNING* Missing application sasl. Can not upgrade with this release. Problem?


15/03: 
Today, as I will need an ESP32 acting as a micro-controller for the computer, I decided to install everything required. You can either code via Platformio on VSCode (tbh, I do not recommand, it seems a little bit shaky on my computer... It works, but not really intuitive) or you can go with the Arduino IDE.
First, install the Arduino IDE (follow the tutorial from this link: https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing/)
Next, follow this tutorial: https://bromleysat.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide
I encountered several problems:
	- The PySerial was not installed. I had to add it to have the tutorial from the link above working: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-serial-package-on-linux/
	- I struggled with my port (dev/ttyUSB0). I followed what was on this link : https://askubuntu.com/questions/133235/how-do-i-allow-non-root-access-to-ttyusb0
		I just did the sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER thing and restarted my computer. The port problem was then gone.
	- The board that I have is a NodeMCU-32S, not a DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 like in the tutorial. Beware of the version you have. I bought mine here (if you want to have the same board, so NodeMCU-32S) : https://www.amazon.com.be/dp/B07S1GGM35?ref_=pe_43847721_708903971_E_301_dt_1
	- Still regarding the ports, you may have a port problem if you do not have the driver UART-USB cp120x installed. On Ubuntu, it should be by default. If not, you can follow this : https://askubuntu.com/questions/941594/installing-cp210x-driver
	
	
16/03: REMINDER: add your wpa.supplicant.conf to your gitignore. 
Added make hera_push: this is to run a bash script to push with your password and username on your git repo. Modify it to have your credentials. The bash script should be put in gitignore aswell, as you will have your credentials in it. 
If you want to create your own bash, feel free. But do not forget to do "chmod +x bashFileName.sh" to add execution rights.
Safer option: instead of your password, use something like: $ENVVAR and set the env variable with export ENVVAR=yourpassword. This ONLY WORKS in your current shell session, just like the rebar3 variable. Remember to always do the 3 commands upon starting a shell.

I also added a build command in the makefile, to automatically build and deploy on the card of choice. It strangely does not work, however. Probably because it happens in a shell of its own, and that I do not have the right rights in that shell.

DO NOT FORGET: whenever you change something to your Hera, always remove the _build and _grisp files from the build. Or you'll waste 15 minutes of your life.

16/03: STILL AT IT, that freacking timeout.
I modified the push_hera version to also clean the _grisp and _build folders, to do all in one command.
If you prefer calling a separate command, make clear is still there.

(do an erratum with the typical error that I encounter)
BEWARE: you cannot print "Message + "some text"" in a io:format, if Message is an argument.
Also: badmatch: if you added print, maybe you stopped the return of the function itself, and thus, it doesn't find the new value. You can : store the return value in a variable, print, then return the variable.

We verified the time dependency of e11, because we realised it crashed after 3 measures (with the default timeout of 5 seconds. 10 seconds: crashed after 4. 60 seconds : crashed after 6). The time evolution between 2 iterations of e11:measure is globally looking like N²*log(N).
Checking if the culprit was Kalman, the answer in no.

We also discarded the hypothesis that the PMOD_NAV was taking to much time.
We checked many culprits. Everytime, it seemed like we were getting close, but yet, not finding anything.


17/03: 
ALL GPIO PINS can be used as interrupt on ESP32.
ALL GPIO PINS OK FOR OUTPUT can be used for PWM on ESP32.
The code for the interrupt can be tagged with IRAM_ATTR to be stored in the RAM, instead of FLASH.

Beware : if you did not detect the socket, the sensor_fusion:launch() will not work. Check the console to see if you did find it.

INSTALLING & USING HERA, SENSOR_FUSION, etc. :

I started by going on the repository of Hera (https://github.com/sebkm/hera) and git cloned it to wherever you want.
Compile it (rebar3 compile).
In sensor_fusion from Lucas Nélis (https://github.com/lunelis/sensor_fusion/tree/master/src), you can find in src/ the file sensor_fusion.app.src, where you can see that hera is called as an application, from which you can get functions.
In the end, you do not need to get hera, for that it is directly imported in rebar.config from the sensor_fusion application. So git clone sensor_fusion instead.

For the application's build, he mentions using Docker. We had big problems with the docker, the build was not working. It appears that rebar3 does not know what docker is, despite having installed it.
(To install docker, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
After basically 1h of scanning the Internet and even asking ChatGPT, we went on the docker hub website, into the grisp/grisp2-rtems-toolchain and we did the docker pull:
sudo docker pull grisp/grisp2-rtems-toolchain (we did this to have the docker image locally. Doing this without sudo failed (daemon socket connection error).)
This sadly did nothing.

What we did to get the docker running is that on this page (https://github.com/grisp/rebar3_grisp/releases), they mention adding the docker toolchain possibility. 
Downloading the .zip, in one of the files of the src/ directory, we saw that it was trying to ask for "docker info", which returned an error, leading to the problem.
To get rid of this, we followed the advices given on this page: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-error
This allowed us to have a functionning docker! 

Next, putting the right Erlang/OTP version in the rebar.config file, we got to a new error. It did not find a C compiler for the code.

Despite our best efforts, we could not make the docker work. After extensive research, we decided to go with a toolchain. 
Go to: https://github.com/grisp/grisp2-rtems-toolchain and git clone the repo, then "make install" inside the repository. This will take A WHILE. A LONG WHILE.
Then, in rebar.config, instead of {docker, "grisp/grisp2-rtems-toolchain"}, put {directory, "where_is_your_toolchain_installed"} 
(e.g. for me: {directory, "/home/nicolas/TFE/grisp2-rtems-toolchain/rtems/5"}). 
You should now be able to compile sensor_fusion. Go to the directory and type "rebar3 grisp build". Again, this will take a while.
Then, I used the make file as Lucas Nélis did and deployed it.
